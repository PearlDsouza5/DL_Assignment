    "\n",
    "For example, in a neural network with an input layer, an output layer, and a single hidden layer, the hidden size of that layer would refer to the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The input and output layers have a fixed size determined by the input and output of the task being performed, but the number of neurons in the hidden layer can vary and is typically chosen by the user based on the complexity of the task.\n",

A larger hidden size may allow the network to learn more complex features, but may also increase the risk of overfitting.

    "7. Why is matrix multiplication written in plain Python very slow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Matrix multiplication involves a large number of arithmetic operations, and performing those operations using the basic Python operations can be slow because Python is an interpreted language, which means that it has to interpret and execute each line of code at runtime. This can lead to a significant overhead when working with large matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the built-in data structures in Python, such as lists or tuples, are not optimized for numerical operations and lack the efficient memory access patterns that are required for efficient matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, specialized numerical libraries such as NumPy or TensorFlow are written in optimized C or Fortran code, which allows for much faster execution of numerical operations. They also offer various optimizations such as parallelism, vectorization, and caching, which further improve the performance of matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if you need to perform matrix multiplication, it's recommended to use a specialized library such as NumPy, which provides optimized functions for matrix operations and can execute them much faster than plain Python."

    "Ans: In matrix multiplication, two matrices A and B can be multiplied only if the number of columns of A (denoted by 'c') is equal to the number of rows of B (denoted by 'r').\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write matmul(A,B), A is assumed to be a matrix of shape (a, c) and B is assumed to be a matrix of shape (c, b). The resulting matrix C from the matrix multiplication of A and B would have the shape (a, b).\n",
    "\n",
    "The element at row 'i' and column 'j' in C can be calculated by taking the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. This requires that the length of the row in A (i.e., 'c') must be equal to the length of the column in B (also 'c'). Therefore, we have the requirement that ac == br in order to perform matrix multiplication using matmul.\n",

    "9. In Jupyter Notebook, how do you measure the time taken for a single cell to execute?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To measure the time taken for a single cell to execute in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use the %%timeit magic command. This command runs the cell multiple times and provides the average time taken for the cell to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the %%timeit command, you simply need to add it at the beginning of the cell you want to time. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "%%timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your code here\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you run the cell with the %%timeit command, Jupyter Notebook will execute the cell multiple times with different inputs and record the time taken for each execution. It will then calculate the average time taken and display it along with other statistics such as standard deviation and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also use the %time command to measure the time taken for a single execution of a cell. This command provides more detailed information than %%timeit, but it only runs the cell once. To use %time, simply add it at the beginning of the cell you want to time, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "%time\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your code here\n",

    "10. What is elementwise arithmetic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Elementwise arithmetic refers to performing arithmetic operations on the corresponding elements of two or more arrays or matrices. In elementwise arithmetic, each element of one array is paired with the corresponding element of another array, and the arithmetic operation is performed on those pairs of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given two arrays A and B, elementwise addition would involve adding each element of A to the corresponding element of B, resulting in a new array C where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elementwise arithmetic is commonly used in numerical computations, particularly in linear algebra and machine learning. In Python, libraries such as NumPy provide efficient support for elementwise arithmetic operations on arrays and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elementwise arithmetic is different from matrix multiplication, where each element in the resulting matrix is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of two input matrices. In matrix multiplication, the input matrices must have compatible shapes, whereas in elementwise arithmetic, the input arrays must have the same shape."

    "Ans: expand_as is a PyTorch tensor method that allows you to expand a tensor to the size of another tensor. This can be useful when you want to perform operations between tensors of different sizes that are not broadcastable.\n",
